# basic-sudoku-solver
This simple sudoku solver is designed as a first-semester project that will push our boundaries as we learn C++. 

As of starting this project, we only know the absolute basics of programming in C++ and have no idea how to implement the solver. Over the course of the semester, we aim to grow our skills and discover how we can go about solving this problem. As much as possible, we want the code we write to be our own. This means that, even though this is a program that has been written a thousand times before, everything we write should come from our own brains.
